## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

1. **Microservices First**: Decompose into small, focused services
2. **API-First Design**: Design APIs before implementation
3. **Event-Driven**: Use events for loose coupling between services
4. **Resilient**: Build for failure and recovery
5. **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
6. **Secure by Design**: Security built into every layer

## üîß Technology Decisions

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js / Fastify
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Message Queue**: NATS / Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
